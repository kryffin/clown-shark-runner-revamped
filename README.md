# Clown Shark Runner

This is my first finished game made on Unity.  
It took me around one and a half month from start to finish using a Trello to organize my work into sprints.

The game is available to play on my itch.io page :

## What's Clown Shark Runner ?

Clown Shark Runner is a runner game where you play as a clown shark trying to avoid obstacles.  
The goal is simple : get as far as you can !

## Runner

The speed at which obstacles spawn and moves increase in time, but your shark doesn't move faster sideways !  
There is a range of bonuses to help you beat your previous time and conquer the sea.

## Voxels

I chose to do voxel art for the game as it was the fastest for me to do.  
I didn't want to bother learning and increasing my drawing or 3D skills for the scope of this game.

## Clown Shark

Sharks are way too aggressive-looking, why not add it a clown skin ?
